helpdoc={help_top:"<h5>Tutorials</h5><a href='http://www.stefanom.org/category/systemic-live/' target='_new'>Go to tutorial</a><h5>Systems</h5>The System dropdown lists all the available stars that have public radial velocity observations associated with them. Each star has been observed by one or more telescopes (e.g. KECK, HARPS, AAT, etc.). Selecting a new system will load the data (shown as colorful dots in the Radial Velocity plot.)<h5>Optimize fit</h5>The \"Optimize fit\" tool will attempt to improve the match between the model fit and the radial velocity observations (i.e. decrease the value of Chi<sup>2</sup>) by varying the values of the planetary parameters (e.g. period, mass, etc.) and the velocity offsets. Only parameters that are checked (<input type=\"checkbox\" checked>) will be varied; the others will be held fixed.",help_rvplot:"<h5>Radial velocity plot</h5>This plot shows the available data for the selected system. Each dot represent a single observation at a given time (in Julian Days) on the x-axis and the recorded Doppler shift on the y-axis (in meters/second). Each telescope has a different dot color.<br>The black curve is the predicted response velocity due to the presence of a planetary system. It will be a zero-velocity line if there are no planets, a sinusoidal line if there is one planet in a circular orbit, and a more complicated curve with multiple/eccentric planets.",help_statistics:"<h5>Statistics</h5>This table shows the values of several properties calculated from the current planetary configuration: <br><ul><li>Chi<sup>2</sup><sub>red</sub> is a measure of the goodness of the model fit;</li><li>RMS is the root mean square of the residuals (a measure of the amount of Doppler shift that is not explained by the planetary tug); </li><li>Jitter is a rough measure of the residual stellar noise, assuming the model is correct;</li></ul>",help_offsets:"<h5>Telescope offsets</h5>This table shows the different telescopes that have observed the system. The parameter fields allow shifting the zero-point of the radial velocity datasets up and down.",help_planets:"<h5>Planets</h5>Click on Add Planet to add a new planet to the system. You can have up to 6 planets. Each planet will change the radial velocity curve according to its orbital elements, listed below:<ul><li>Period is the orbital period of the planet, in days.</li><li>Mass is the mass of the planet in Jupiter masses.</li><li>Mean Anomaly is the phase of the planet (i.e. where it is along its orbit) at the time of the first radial velocity observation.</li><li>Eccentricity changes the shape of the orbit. An eccentricity of 0 is a perfectly circular orbit; as the eccentricity increases, the orbit becomes more elliptical.</li> <li>Longitude of pericenter sets the orientation of the orbit with respect to the observer, changing the direction of the major axis of the orbital ellipse. </li></ul>",help_orbit:'<h5>Orbital plot</h5>This figure shows the orbital configuration of the planets.
